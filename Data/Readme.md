## Dataset Description

Decision fatigue is a well-documented cognitive phenomenon in which prolonged decision-making reduces an individual’s ability to evaluate options accurately and efficiently. In modern work, academic, and operational environments, people are often required to make continuous decisions under limited rest, frequent task switching, and varying stress levels.

This dataset models such conditions using logically structured behavioral data. Each record represents a simulated decision-making state during an active period. The dataset includes behavioral, cognitive, and lifestyle variables such as accumulated hours awake, number of decisions made, average decision time, task switching frequency, sleep duration from the previous night, caffeine intake, and perceived stress.

Variables are generated with consistent cause-and-effect relationships rather than independently. As cognitive demand increases and recovery remains insufficient, the data reflects realistic behavioral patterns, including slower decision response times, increasing error rates, and elevated cognitive load.

A decision fatigue score is computed as a composite measure derived from these interacting variables, providing a continuous representation of mental strain. This score is additionally categorized into low, moderate, and high fatigue levels, enabling both regression and classification use cases.

Fatigue levels emerge naturally from sustained cognitive pressure and insufficient recovery rather than being arbitrarily assigned. Feature relationships remain interpretable and aligned with established findings in cognitive psychology and human performance research.

## Intended Use

This dataset is designed for educational and applied machine learning purposes, including:
- Human performance modeling  
- Cognitive workload assessment  
- Fatigue detection  
- Adaptive decision support system design  

The dataset emphasizes realism, consistency, and analytical value, making it suitable for exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and algorithm benchmarking in a controlled and reproducible setting.
